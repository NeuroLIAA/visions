## Preprocessed images
Images had to be uploaded to an external server due to their size. The already-processed images can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1vDQbUiEF2VFNyiCfw4JhMeAyIil0cEAf).

## Raw data
To run the processing scripts on the unmodified data, download the file *coco_search18_fixations_TP_test.json* from the official website and place it in the folder ```data_raw```.
