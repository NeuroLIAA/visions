## Stimuli
Images can be downloaded from the official website and must be placed in the ```images``` folder.

## Raw data
To run the processing scripts on the unmodified data, download the eye-tracking data from the official website and place it in the folder ```data_raw/eyeData```. Before running the scripts, three trials should be excluded (due to containing multiple targets): U123_1RBE.jpg, U0126_1LBE.jpg, U0340_1RBH.jpg.
